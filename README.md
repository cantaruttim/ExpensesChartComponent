# Expenses Chart Component

The ideia was built the same expensive bar chart as same as the frontendmentor challenges website (https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges), however I decided
to import for this project a library called Plotly to build my interactive bar chart, highlighting a different color when the container was selected.

This user interaction was made with JavaScript. Some of my personal challenges was to use and import the library to my project and how to make that to look as close as possible
to the initial projects and to adapt to my own ideias.

## Languages & Tools:

  <div style="display: inline_block"><br>
  <img align="center" alt="Canta-HTML" height="30" width="40" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/html5/html5-original.svg">
  <img align="center" alt="Canta-CSS" height="30" width="40" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/css3/css3-original.svg">
  <img align="center" alt="Canta-Js" height="30" width="40" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/javascript/javascript-plain.svg">
  </div>

## The Challenge:

Your users should be able to:

- View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the current day's bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## The project:
You can see how the project looks like in the image bellow
